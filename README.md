# Tax Calculator

This app is for recruiting purpose only.

## IMPORTANT
This program assumes that preformatted data will be correct, so there are not validations implemented.

Also, the results are not accurate due to specific rounding format. Maybe with more time I could do it 100% accurate.

## How to run the program

You just need to execute this command in your terminal:

`ruby main.rb [file]`

where file is an argument and it's inside the folder app.

That's it.
